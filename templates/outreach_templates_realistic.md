## TEMPLATE 1: AESTHETIC CLINIC - HIGH VOLUME OPTIMIZATION

### Subject: Ai Beauty Ltd - Consultation Booking Optimization Opportunity

Dear [Name / Team],

I noticed Ai Beauty Ltd has been running substantial advertising campaigns (120+ ads) across Google's platform, which indicates serious commitment to patient acquisition.

**What caught my attention:** Your advertising volume suggests monthly spend around £2,200 - that level of investment deserves maximum ROI optimization.

**Specific opportunity:** Most aesthetic clinics with your advertising volume see 15-25% improvement in cost-per-consultation through:
- Premium positioning strategy refinement
- Consultation booking funnel optimization  
- Ad spend allocation analysis

**Quick question:** Are you currently tracking cost-per-consultation across your campaigns, or would a 30-minute analysis call be valuable?

I specialize in aesthetic clinic marketing optimization and have worked with similar premium practices to improve patient acquisition efficiency.

**Next step:** Free 30-minute consultation audit call to identify immediate optimization opportunities.
