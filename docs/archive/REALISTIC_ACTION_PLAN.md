- Contact person (CEO/CMO/VP), email if available
```

**Day 3-4: Simple Analyzer Build**

```python
class RealisticAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validated_prospects = self.load_manual_research()

    def analyze_with_ground_truth(self, domain):
        # Test against manually researched data
        # Return accuracy scores vs real data
        # Focus on business type detection first
```

**Day 5-7: First Outreach Test**

```
Target: Send 5 emails to validated prospects
Track: Opens, replies, meeting requests
Goal: 1 response (20% response rate)

        self.daily_limit = 10  # Realistic daily target
        self.accuracy_threshold = 0.8

    def process_prospect(self, domain):
        # Analyze using proven methods from weeks 1-2

## 💡 MATURE APPROACH PRINCIPLES

### **Build → Validate → Scale**

1. Start com 20 prospects reais, manual validation
2. Build tool que funciona para estes 20 com accuracy provada
3. Scale gradually mantendo quality standards

### **Business Metrics First**

1. Response rate > processing speed
2. Meetings booked > prospects discovered
3. Deals closed > qualification scores
4. ROI demonstrated > technical sophistication

### **Customer-Centric Discovery**

1. Pain points via customer research, não website scraping
2. Revenue estimates com data sources, não algorithms
3. Messages tested com real responses, não theoretical relevance

## ✅ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### **Today (July 16)**

1. **Manual Research**: Identificar 5 prospects reais com LinkedIn/Crunchbase validation
2. **Simple Test**: Send 1 email manual para testar messaging approach
3. **Data Collection**: Track response + learn from interaction

### **This Week**

1. **Scale Research**: 20 prospects com manual validation completa
2. **Build Simple Tool**: Analyzer que funciona para estes 20 prospects
3. **Test Outreach**: 5 emails reais, track responses, improve messaging

### **Success Checkpoint (Week 1)**

- [ ] 20 prospects manually validated with accurate data
