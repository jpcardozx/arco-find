## 🎯 **VERTICAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**

### ✅ **SUCCESSFUL VERTICAL: ROOFING**

- **UK Market**: 24 prospects found (London/Dublin/Manchester)
- **Query Success**: "roofing" worked universally
- **Spend Estimates**: £1,800/month average (vs $750 AUD Australian)
- **Market Insight**: UK roofing companies spend 2.4x more than Australian counterparts

### ❌ **FAILED VERTICALS**

#### 1. **HVAC/Heating (Boiler Repair)**

- **Results**: 0 prospects across all cities
- **Queries Tested**: "boiler repair", "heating repair", "gas engineer"
- **Issue**: UK heating market may use different terminology
- **Recommendation**: Try "plumber", "gas safe engineer", "central heating"

#### 2. **Water Damage/Restoration**

- **Results**: 24 prospects found BUT not qualifying
- **Issue**: Pain detection logic not adapted for UK market terminology
- **Recommendation**: Adjust pain signals for UK insurance/claims language

## 🌍 **GEOGRAPHIC INSIGHTS**

### 🏙️ **London Metro (Best Performance)**

### 🍀 **Dublin Area**

## 🔍 **CRITICAL DISCOVERIES**

### 🚨 **Technical Issues Identified**

#### 1. **API Query Limitations**

```
HVAC Queries Failed:
- "boiler repair" → 0 results
- "heating repair" → 0 results
- "gas engineer" → 0 results
```

**ROOT CAUSE**: Google Ads Transparency Center may have limited coverage for UK heating/plumbing sectors, or terminology mismatch.

#### 2. **Pain Detection Logic Not Localized**

```json
"actionable_insights": [
  "POSITIONING AUDIT: Sykes Roofing não tem diferenciação clara"
]
```

**ISSUE**: Portuguese insights still showing for UK market - localization incomplete.

#### 3. **Currency Conversion Working**

- Successfully converted to GBP
- Spend estimates realistic for UK market (£1,800/month vs $750 AUD)
