Hi [Name],

I was researching ad performance in your market and noticed {company} is running active campaigns with some concerning technical issues that are directly impacting your ROI.

SPECIFIC FINDINGS:
â€¢ PageSpeed Insights: {psi_score}/100 (Google recommends 90+)
â€¢ Load time: {lcp_seconds}s (should be <2.5s for optimal ad performance)  
â€¢ Additional issues: {rationale}

These problems are likely costing you ~${waste:,}/month in wasted ad spend through:
- Higher CPCs due to poor Quality Scores
- Lost conversions from slow load times
- Poor user experience driving up bounce rates

I can show you exactly what's happening and how to fix it in a 20-minute technical audit.

Would tomorrow at [TIME] work for a quick screen-share where I walk through the specific issues and fixes?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. I've helped similar {company.split()[-1].lower()} businesses reduce their acquisition costs by 30-50% through technical optimization. Happy to send case studies if you're interested."""

Hi [Name],

I recorded a quick 5-minute technical analysis of {domain} that shows the specific issues costing you ${waste:,}/month:

[ATTACH: Screen recording showing PSI analysis + highlighting issues]

Key findings:
1. Core Web Vitals failing ({psi_score}/100 PSI score)
2. Message-match disconnects between ads and landing pages
3. Conversion tracking gaps risking attribution loss

IMMEDIATE IMPACT:
â€¢ Every 1-second improvement in load time = 20% conversion increase
â€¢ Fixing Quality Score issues = 25-40% CPC reduction
â€¢ Proper tracking = 15-25% better campaign optimization

I have a slot today at [TIME] to walk through these findings and show you the exact fixes needed.

The technical audit investment is $350, and most clients see positive ROI within the first week of implementation.

Should I send the calendar link?

Best,
[Your Name]"""

[Name],

Quick follow-up on the technical issues I found with {company}.

The ${waste:,}/month waste is accumulating daily, and with Q4 approaching, these performance gaps will become more expensive as competition increases.

I'm holding one audit slot today (expires 6 PM) - here's what you'll get:

âœ“ Complete technical analysis (20+ point checklist)
âœ“ Specific fixes ranked by ROI impact  
âœ“ Side-by-side before/after projections
âœ“ Implementation roadmap with timelines

Investment: $350 (typical ROI: 4-8x within 30 days)

If you're dealing with any of these frustrations:
â€¢ Ads getting expensive but conversions staying flat
â€¢ Agency can't explain why performance is declining  
â€¢ Feeling like you're "throwing money at Google"

Then this audit will give you clarity and a specific action plan.

Book here: [CALENDAR LINK]
or simply reply with a time that works.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. I analyzed 47 businesses in your vertical last month - 89% had the same Core Web Vitals issues I found on {domain}. The ones who fixed it quickly gained significant competitive advantage."""
