# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing /arco pipeline with real marketing data integration and leak detection capabilities. The implementation will extend current engines and models to incorporate actual Google Analytics and Google Ads data, replacing simulated metrics with industry-benchmarked insights. The solution integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture in /arco/engines and /arco/models without requiring structural changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a marketing analyst, I want to extend the existing /arco enrichment engine with real marketing data, so that lead qualification uses actual performance metrics instead of simulated values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing enrichment engine processes a prospect THEN it SHALL extend the current Prospect model with marketing_data fields
2. WHEN marketing data is collected THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing /arco/models/prospect.py structure
3. WHEN Google Analytics integration fails THEN the system SHALL use existing fallback patterns from /arco/engines
4. IF web performance issues are detected THEN they SHALL be stored using the existing /arco/models/leak.py pattern

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a marketing analyst, I want to enhance the existing leak detection engine with real Google Ads data, so that I can identify actual cost inefficiencies using the current /arco/engines/leak_engine.py structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the leak_engine processes a prospect THEN it SHALL extend current leak detection with real ad spend analysis
2. WHEN ad spend data is collected THEN it SHALL use existing industry benchmark patterns from /arco/config
3. IF marketing inefficiencies are detected THEN they SHALL be stored as MarketingLeak objects extending current leak models
4. WHEN API integrations are added THEN they SHALL follow existing /arco/integrations patterns with proper error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a lead qualification specialist, I want to enhance existing /arco qualification criteria with industry-specific benchmarks, so that the current qualification engine uses realistic sector-based thresholds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing qualification engine processes a prospect THEN it SHALL extend current /arco/config criteria with industry-specific rules
2. WHEN industry-specific criteria are applied THEN they SHALL integrate with existing QualificationCriteria patterns in /arco/models
3. WHEN qualification results are generated THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing /arco pipeline outputs
4. IF industry benchmarks are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use existing default criteria from /arco/config

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to fix the existing Wappalyzer integration in /arco/engines and add robust fallbacks, so that technology detection works reliably within the current pipeline architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing technology enrichment in /arco/engines fails THEN it SHALL use HTTP header analysis following current engine patterns
2. WHEN fallback mechanisms are implemented THEN they SHALL integrate with existing /arco/utils error handling
3. WHEN technology detection completes THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with current Technology model in /arco/models
4. IF all detection methods fail THEN the system SHALL use industry-based technology assignment from /arco/config patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a marketing analyst, I want to extend the existing /arco/engines/leak_engine.py with real marketing leak detection, so that I can quantify actual waste using the current leak detection architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing leak_engine analyzes marketing data THEN it SHALL extend current leak detection patterns with performance impact calculations
2. WHEN CPC and conversion data is available THEN it SHALL use existing benchmark comparison logic from /arco/config
3. WHEN marketing leaks are detected THEN they SHALL be stored using existing Leak model patterns in /arco/models
4. WHEN leak analysis completes THEN it SHALL integrate with existing reporting mechanisms in /arco/pipelines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CRM administrator, I want enriched lead data with marketing context, so that sales teams have actionable insights about each prospect's digital marketing efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a qualified lead is sent to CRM THEN the system SHALL include marketing performance metrics and detected inefficiencies
2. WHEN marketing waste is detected THEN the system SHALL include specific dollar amounts and improvement recommendations in CRM fields
3. WHEN web performance issues are found THEN the system SHALL include technical recommendations and estimated conversion impact
4. IF no marketing data is available THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data limitations in CRM fields

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a sales manager, I want to identify the top 10% highest-priority leads through rapid scoring analysis, so that I can focus immediate outreach efforts on the most promising prospects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a batch of prospects THEN it SHALL calculate a priority score based on company size, revenue potential, technology stack, and growth indicators
2. WHEN priority scoring is complete THEN it SHALL rank all prospects and identify the top 10% for immediate attention
3. WHEN high-priority leads are identified THEN the system SHALL provide decision-maker contact information and company intelligence
4. IF scoring data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL use available data and indicate confidence levels

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want personalized outreach recommendations for high-priority leads, so that I can approach decision-makers with relevant, data-driven value propositions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a high-priority lead is selected for outreach THEN the system SHALL generate personalized messaging based on detected inefficiencies and industry benchmarks
2. WHEN outreach content is generated THEN it SHALL include specific dollar amounts, technical recommendations, and competitive insights
3. WHEN decision-maker information is available THEN the system SHALL provide role-specific talking points and pain points
4. IF marketing data is limited THEN the system SHALL focus on technology and industry-based value propositions
