## üè¢ **DEAL PLUMBING INC** - PRIORIDADE M√ÅXIMA

### üìß **EMAIL INICIAL**

**Subject:** Quick question about Deal Plumbing's $2,500/month ad performance

Hi [Name],

I was analyzing Toronto's emergency plumbing market and noticed Deal Plumbing Inc is spending around $2,500/month on ads.

What caught my attention: your messaging shows competitive pressure ("affordable", "emergency") which typically signals 25-40% waste in ad spend.

Quick question - are you tracking cost-per-acquisition on your current campaigns?

Most plumbing businesses I work with are surprised to discover they're losing $1,500+ monthly to poor targeting, even with solid operations like yours.

Just helped Reliable Plumbing (similar size, Toronto area) eliminate $3,200/month in waste by repositioning away from price competition.

Worth a 15-minute call to show you the specific inefficiencies I spotted in your campaigns?

Best,  
[Your Name]

P.S. With winter season approaching, fixing this now means capturing peak demand at 40% lower acquisition costs.

### üìû **COLD CALL SCRIPT**

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I specialize in helping Toronto service businesses optimize their marketing spend.

I noticed Deal Plumbing is investing around $2,500 monthly in advertising, and your messaging suggests competitive pressure.

Quick question - are you satisfied with your cost per lead from those campaigns?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

The reason I'm calling is I identified about $1,600 monthly in potential waste in your current approach. Most emergency plumbers are surprised by how much they're overpaying for leads.

I just helped a similar business eliminate $3,200/month by repositioning away from price competition.

Do you have 5 minutes to hear what I found specifically with your campaigns?"

I've been tracking Watermark Plumbing's campaigns - noticed you're running consistent $2,000+ monthly spend with long campaign durations.
